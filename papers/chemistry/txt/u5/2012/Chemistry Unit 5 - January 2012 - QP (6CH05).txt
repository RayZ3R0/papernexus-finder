Molecular structure and colour chemistry
 
The sight of tubes of paint or of coloured pencils in an artists’ supply shop is 
something that most people enjoy; we love colour.
 
The ability to synthesise brightly-coloured compounds coincides with the rapid 
growth of the organic chemicals industry.  Synthetic organic dyes started to 
appear in the mid-19th century when William Perkin synthesised Mauve in 
1856 at the age of 18.  He was trying to synthesise quinine even though he did 
not know the structure of the molecule.
 
In the 19th century many chemists did not believe that molecules existed.  The 
work of Butlerov, Couper, and notably Kekulé showed that molecules not only 
exist but have specific structures.  In 1865 Kekulé suggested a ring structure for 
the aromatic compound benzene which he represented as
 
Kekulé knew that benzene does not react with bromine water.  Later work 
showed that the enthalpy change of hydrogenation of the compound is 
–205 kJ mol–1,  rather than the value of  –360 kJ mol–1 that would be expected 
if the structure was exactly as shown above, given that the enthalpy change of 
hydrogenation for cyclohexene to cyclohexane
 
is –120 kJ mol–1.
 
When Greiss in 1856 discovered diazotisation and the azo dyes, he used a 
reaction characteristic of aromatic amines.  Witt, in 1876, found the functional 
groups in the dye molecule that make it water-soluble and enable it to attach to 
the cloth fibres.  Graebe, Liebermann and Perkin in 1869 patented the synthesis 
of alizarin, found in madder root grown in Holland and Von Baeyer synthesised 
indigo in 1880, until then grown in India.  Synthetic dyes were made available 
in large quantities and were cheaper than the sources from plants.
 
Now the organic chemical industry produces a vast range of pigments and 
dyestuffs for use in paints and for fabrics, inks and other materials, making our 
world the most colourful that it has ever been.

(d) (i) Phenylamine is converted into the benzenediazonium cation using sodium nitrite 
and hydrochloric acid at a temperature between 0 °C and 10 °C.
 
 
 
Explain why the temperature must not be lower or higher than these limits if a 
good yield is to be obtained.
