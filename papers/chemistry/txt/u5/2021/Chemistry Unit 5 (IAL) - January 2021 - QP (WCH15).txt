Coffee Chemistry
24	 There are over a thousand chemical compounds in coffee and their physiological 
effects are the subject of considerable speculation and research. The verdict on coffee 
is contradictory: some of the compounds have been identified as toxic and even 
carcinogenic but others are antioxidants associated with cancer prevention. Recent 
research has identified compounds in coffee that might be used in the treatment of 
prostate cancer.
	
By far the best known compound in coffee is caffeine, the most widely consumed 
psychoactive drug in the world. In small amounts it is a stimulant but doses in excess 
of 10 g per day are toxic. Caffeine contains amide and amine groups.

(b)	 A 200 cm3 cup of coffee contains approximately 85 mg of caffeine.
	
	
(i)	 Calculate the concentration, in mol dm−3, of caffeine in this cup of coffee.  
Give your answer to an appropriate number of significant figures.

(ii)	 The removal of caffeine from the body is a first order reaction with a half-life 
of between three and seven hours for an adult.
	
	
	
An adult drinks coffee containing a total of 160 mg of caffeine.
	
	
	
Calculate to the nearest hour the minimum time needed for the amount of 
caffeine in their body to drop to 20 mg.

(i)	 A student suggested that caffeic acid could be synthesised by an electrophilic 
substitution of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene.
	
	
	
Draw the mechanism of this electrophilic substitution, including the formation 
of a suitable electrophile.
