5 A student carried out an experiment to determine the value of x in the formula of 
hydrated sodium bromide, NaBr.xH2O.
 
Hydrated sodium bromide is heated until all the water of crystallization is removed.  
Anhydrous sodium bromide, NaBr, is formed.
 
The student was given the following instructions.
 
 Weigh a sample of the hydrated sodium bromide crystals in a pre-weighed crucible.
 
 Heat the crucible containing the sample to remove the water of crystallization.
 
 Allow the crucible to cool and then reweigh the crucible.
 
The studentâ€™s results are shown in the table below.
 
(a) Complete the table.

Mass of crucible + contents before heating / g
21.49
Mass of crucible + contents after heating / g

sodium bromide crystals.
