(b)	 To identify the cations in sodium chloride and potassium carbonate, a student 
carried out flame tests using the following method.
	
	
Step 1 	A sample of solid sodium chloride was placed on a watch glass and a few drops 
of concentrated nitric acid were added. The solid and acid were mixed to form 
a paste.
	
	
Step 2	 A length of copper wire was dipped into the paste.
	
	
Step 3 	A Bunsen burner was set up with the air-hole closed. The copper wire containing 
the paste was placed into the Bunsen burner flame and the colour observed.
	
	
Step 4 	The procedure was repeated using solid potassium carbonate.
	
	
For each of the Steps 1, 2 and 3 give an improvement in the procedure explaining 
why the change is necessary.

5	 A student carried out an experiment to identify the metal M in the  
hydrated carbonate M2CO3.10H2O. 
	
A solution was made by dissolving 3.56 g of the hydrated metal carbonate in distilled 
water and making the volume up to 250.0 cm3 in a volumetric flask. 
	
25.0 cm3 of this solution was placed in a conical flask and titrated with 0.100 mol dm−3 
of hydrochloric acid. 
 	
The equation for the reaction is
M2CO3(aq) + 2HCl(aq)  →  2MCl(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
