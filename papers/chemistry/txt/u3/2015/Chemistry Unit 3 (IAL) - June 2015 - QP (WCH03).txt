3 This question is about enthalpy changes which occur on dissolving different substances.
 
(a) The enthalpy change which occurs when solid ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, 
dissolves in water was found using the method below.
 
 
25.0 cm3 of water was measured using a burette and put into a small beaker. 
The temperature of the water was measured.
 
 
5.00 g of powdered ammonium chloride was added to the water, the mixture  
was stirred continuously and the lowest temperature of the resulting solution  
was recorded.
 
 
Results:
 
 
Initial temperature of water        =    22.0qC
 
 
Lowest recorded temperature    =    11.5qC
 
 
(i) Calculate the energy transferred when 5.00 g of ammonium chloride dissolves 
in 25.0 cm3 of water.
 
 
 
Hence calculate the enthalpy change, ¨Hsolution, which occurs when 1 mol of 
ammonium chloride dissolves in water.
 
 
 
Give your final answer to three significant figures and include a sign and units.
 
 
 
Use the equation:
 
 
 
Energy transferred (J) = mass of water × 4.18 × temperature change.
 
 
 
The density of water is 1.00 g cm–3

(ii) The thermometer used in this experiment gave a total uncertainty in the 
temperature measurement of just under ±5%. 
 
 
 
The mass of ammonium chloride was measured using a balance which had an 
uncertainty of ±0.005 g in each reading.
 
 
 
Show by calculation that the uncertainty of the result of the experiment 
would not be improved significantly if a more precise balance was used.

(b) In order to determine a more accurate value for the temperature change, the 
experiment in (a) was repeated with some modifications to the procedure.
 
 
The temperature of the water was measured as a stop clock was started, and 
again after one minute and two minutes.  Three minutes after starting the clock, 
the ammonium chloride was added to the water.  The temperature was then 
read each minute from the fourth to the tenth minute, while stirring the mixture 
continuously.
 
 
(i) On the grid below, mark where you would expect to find the points when the 
temperature measurements are plotted against time.  The initial temperature 
has been plotted for you.  You are not expected to plot the position of the 
points accurately; simply indicate their approximate position relative to the 
starting point.

4 Cyclohexene, C6H10, can be prepared by dehydrating cyclohexanol, C6H11OH, with 
phosphoric acid.
 
H3PO4
C6H11OH 
 C6H10 + H2O
 
Procedure
 
Step 1  12.0 cm3 of cyclohexanol was put into a small flask.  5 cm3 of concentrated 
phosphoric acid, an excess, was added slowly to the cyclohexanol using a 
dropping pipette.  Some anti-bumping granules were added to the mixture 
and the flask was set up for distillation.
 
Step 2  The portion of the distillate collected between 80qC and 90qC contained only 
cyclohexene and water.
 
Step 3  The distillate of cyclohexene and water was transferred to a separating funnel 
and a saturated solution of sodium chloride was added.  Most of the water 
which was in the distillate went into the saturated sodium chloride layer.
 
Step 4  The crude cyclohexene was run out of the separating funnel and dried with 
anhydrous calcium chloride.
 
Step 5  The calcium chloride was removed by filtration through glass wool, and the 
liquid was redistilled to collect pure cyclohexene.
 
Cyclohexene has an unpleasant smell and irritates the eyes, so the entire experiment 
was carried out in a fume cupboard.  In Step 1, tubing was connected to carry any 
uncondensed cyclohexene to a drain.
 
(a) The chemicals involved in this reaction are all hazardous if they make contact with 
the eyes, or if swallowed or inhaled.
 
 
Other than their effect on the eyes or their toxicity, state two different hazards of 
the chemicals involved in this reaction.  Name the chemical associated with each 
hazard.
