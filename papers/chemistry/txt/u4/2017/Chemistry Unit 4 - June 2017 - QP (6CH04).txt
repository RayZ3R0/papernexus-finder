(iv) Use your answers to (c)(ii) and (c)(iii) to calculate ¨Stotal for the reaction at 298 K.

 *(v) It is possible that hydrated barium chloride, BaCl2.2H2O, forms instead of 
anhydrous barium chloride, BaCl2, in this reaction.
 
 
 
Predict any effect on ¨Ssystem if hydrated barium chloride forms instead of 
anhydrous barium chloride.  
 
 
 
Hence explain whether it is possible to predict the effect on the total entropy change 
of the reaction if hydrated barium chloride forms instead of anhydrous barium chloride.
