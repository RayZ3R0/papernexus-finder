7 Acorn Supplies Limited has a small factory, where it produces four steel products 
for the construction industry: beams, fence posts, brackets, and lintels. Production is 
planned according to demand, and the company has seen demand increase. When 
production is planned for Week 43, Acorn Supplies Limited is not sure it is able to 
meet all the orders. This is because it does not have the capacity to heat and melt 
enough steel.

of the four products. The furnace can operate for 12 hours a day. The furnace holds

company is only able to operate the furnace for 12 hours a day, for 6 days a week.
