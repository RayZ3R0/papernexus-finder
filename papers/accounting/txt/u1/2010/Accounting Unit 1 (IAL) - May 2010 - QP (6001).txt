2.	 Jaida is in business buying and selling goods on credit. On 31 March 2010, Jaida extracted a trial 
balance for the business which failed to agree, the debit total of balances exceeding the credit total 
of balances by £1 750. A suspense account was opened to record the difference.
	
Jaida then prepared the draft trading and profit and loss account for the year, before locating the 
errors, which had resulted in the suspense account balance. 
	
The draft trading and profit and loss account prepared on 31 March 2010 was as follows:

After the preparation of the draft trading and profit and loss account, the following errors were 
located:
	
(i)	
A sale of goods £2 300 on credit to Salem, had been recorded in the sales account as £230.
	
(ii)	 Sales returns £170 had been correctly recorded in the account of the debtor, but had been 
credited as £150 in the sales returns account.
	
(iii)	 Purchases included a cash payment of £450 for operating expenses. 
	
(iv)	 Stock at 31 March 2010 contained one stock sheet valued at the list price of £6 000, including 
the ‘mark up’ of 25%.
	
(v)	
The calculation and recording of wages for the year was incorrect. The following actual 
payments were made to Jaida’s three staff members:
	
Ahmed	
Paid an annual salary of £12 000 plus a bonus of £500.
	
Beena	
Paid a monthly salary of £750 plus a commission of 5% of sales. Average 
monthly sales were £8 000.
	
Chandra	
Paid an hourly rate of £3 per hour for 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per 
year. Average overtime worked for 50 weeks of the year was 6 hours at 
time and a half.
	
(vi)	 During the year operating expenses of £5 000 for repairing the vehicle, were recorded in the 
vehicle asset account. Depreciation was charged on the balance of the vehicles account at the 
year end at the rate of 20% on cost using the straight line method. 
	
(vii)	 The provision for doubtful debts on 1 April 2009 was £550 and this was entered in the draft 
profit and loss account. 
	
(viii)	During the year, debts of £600 were written off as bad debts. On 31 March 2010 the debtors 
balance was £18 700 and it was decided to write off an additional £1 200 as bad debts and to 
maintain the provision for doubtful debts at 4% of the remaining debts. This adjustment had 
not been made.
