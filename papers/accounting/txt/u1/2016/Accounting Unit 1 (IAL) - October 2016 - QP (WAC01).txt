The owner of Weston Airways is aware that its two existing aircraft are old and need 
replacing. 
 
The owner proposes to replace the two existing aircraft with two larger 20-seater 
aircraft for the year ended 30 September 2017.
 
The projections for the replacements are as follows:

•
passenger numbers will increase by 10%. Market research shows that each 
passenger will also pay 8% more to fly in the new aircraft
 
•
the aircraft will use 30% less fuel
 
•
aircraft maintenance will be 40% less 
 
•
ground services expenses will rise by 20%
 
•
all other expenses will remain unchanged
 
•
the two existing aircraft will be sold for £100 000 each.
 
There are two proposals for financing the two replacement aircraft. 
 
Proposal 1
 
Purchase the two aircraft at a cost of £900 000 each. The aircraft will depreciate at 
8% per annum using the straight line method. Weston Airways would take out an 
additional £1 500 000 8% bank loan to finance the aircraft.
 
Proposal 2
 
Hire the two aircraft for a period of 12 years at a charge of £125 000 per annum for 
each aircraft. Weston Airways would not have to charge annual depreciation or take 
out an additional bank loan.
 
Required
 
(c) Complete the table in your Question Paper showing the changes to the profit or 
loss for the year ended 30 September 2017 using:

Airways.
