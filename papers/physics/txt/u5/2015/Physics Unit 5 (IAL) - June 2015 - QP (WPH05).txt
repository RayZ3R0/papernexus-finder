12	 A student investigated the properties of chocolate.  He heated 0.75 kg of chocolate 
until it was a few degrees above its melting point.  He then used a temperature sensor 
connected to a datalogger to monitor the temperature of the chocolate as it cooled in  
cold surroundings.

was approximately constant over the temperature range shown in the graph below.

liquid chocolate was about 50 W.

15	 The Sun is a typical star in our galaxy, the Milky Way.  It is 2.5 × 1020 m from the centre 
of the galaxy.  The Sun orbits the centre of the galaxy at a speed of 220 km s−1.
	
The diagrams below represent the Milky Way.  The central black area represents a very 
high density of stars, known as the nucleus of the galaxy.  The total mass of stars within 
the orbit of the Sun may be treated as a point mass at the centre of the galaxy.

16	 In the early 19th century, Heinrich Olbers asked the question, “Why is the night sky 
dark?”  He reasoned that in an infinite universe light from very distant stars should make 
the whole of the visible sky bright. 
	
To see how much distant stars contribute to light reaching the Earth, the universe can be 
modelled as a uniform distribution of identical stars.  If this universe is divided into a 
series of thin concentric ‘shells’ centred on Earth, there will be a certain number of stars 
on each shell.
	
The diagram shows two shells of equal thickness at distances r and 2r from the centre of 
the Earth.
	
There are four times as many stars on the shell at 2r than on the shell at r. 
	
(a)	 Explain why the total radiation flux received at the Earth from the stars on each shell 
is the same.
(2)
.
	
(b)	One explanation proposed for why the night sky is not bright was that there is too 
much dust in space for distant stars to be seen.  However, such dust would absorb 
radiation and heat up.
	
	
(i)	 Space is estimated to be at a temperature of 2.7 K.  Use this value to calculate the 
radiant power emitted per m2 of a body at this temperature.
