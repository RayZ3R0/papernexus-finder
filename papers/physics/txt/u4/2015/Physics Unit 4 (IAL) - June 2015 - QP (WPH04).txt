(b)	Vehicles such as buses may be powered by electric motors.  The motors on these 
buses use batteries which need to be charged often.  This is normally done by 
connecting to a fixed electrical supply whilst the bus is parked.
	
	
The photograph shows a bus on a road in South Korea.  This road enables the 
batteries to charge whilst the bus is in motion.
	
	
Under the road there are electric cables, connected to a 440V 60 Hz supply.  These 
generate magnetic fields.  There is a coil inside the charging device which is located 
below the floor of the bus.  This enables the batteries on the bus to charge.
