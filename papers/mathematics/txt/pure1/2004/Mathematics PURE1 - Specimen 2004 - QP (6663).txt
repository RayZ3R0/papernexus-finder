The points A and B have coordinates (3, 4) and (7, −6) respectively. The straight line 
l passes through A and is perpendicular to AB. Find an equation for l, giving your 
answer in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c are integers. (5) 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 shows a sketch of the curve with equation y = f(x). 
 
The curve crosses the coordinate axes at the points (0, 1) and (3, 0). The maximum point 
on the curve is (1, 2). 
 
On separate diagrams, sketch the curve with equation 
 
(a) y = f(x + 1),

(b) y = f(2x).

On each diagram, show clearly the coordinates of the maximum point, and of each point 
at which the curve crosses the coordinate axes.

Ahmed plans to save £250 in the year 2001, £300 in 2002, £350 in 2003, and so on until 
the year 2020. His planned savings form an arithmetic sequence with common difference 
£50.

Ben also plans to save money over the same 20 year period. He saves £A in the year 2001 
and his planned yearly savings form an arithmetic sequence with common difference £60. 
 
Given that Ben’s total planned savings over the 20 year period are equal to Ahmed’s total 
planned savings over the same period,
