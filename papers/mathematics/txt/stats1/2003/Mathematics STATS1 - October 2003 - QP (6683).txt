Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility 
for  symbolic  algebra,  differentiation  and/or  integration.  Thus 
candidates may NOT use calculators such as the Texas Instruments 
TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre 
number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), your 
surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has six questions. 
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

A fairground game involves trying to hit a moving target with a gunshot. A round consists of up 
to 3 shots. Ten points are scored if a player hits the target, but the round is over if the player 
misses. Linda has a constant probability of 0.6 of hitting the target and shots are independent of 
one another.
(a) Find the probability that Linda scores 30 points in a round.
(2)
The random variable X is the number of points Linda scores in a round.
(b) Find the probability distribution of X.
(5)
(c) Find the mean and the standard deviation of X.
(5)
A game consists of 2 rounds.
(d) Find the probability that Linda scores more points in round 2 than in round 1.

Cooking sauces are sold in jars containing a stated weight of 500 g of sauce The jars are filled by 
a machine. The actual weight of sauce in each jar is normally distributed with mean 505 g and 
standard deviation 10 g.
(a) (i)
Find the probability of a jar containing less than the stated weight.
(ii) In a box of 30 jars, find the expected number of jars containing less than the stated 
weight. 
(5)
The mean weight of sauce is changed so that 1% of the jars contain less than the stated weight. 
The standard deviation stays the same.
(b) Find the new mean weight of sauce.

For these data, find
(a) the mean and the standard deviation,
(3)
(b) the median and the inter-quartile range.
 (4)
An outlier is an observation that falls either more than 1.5  × (inter-quartile range) above the 
upper quartile or more than 1.5 × (inter-quartile range) below the lower quartile.
(c) Determine if any of the prices are outliers.
(3)
The travel agent also sells holidays from a website on the Internet. On the same day, he recorded 
the price, £x, of each of 20 holidays sold on the website. The cheapest holiday sold was £98, the 
most expensive was £2400 and the quartiles of these data were £305, £1379 and £1805. There 
were no outliers.
(d) On graph paper, and using the same scale, draw box plots for the holidays sold in the shop 
and the holidays sold on the website.
(4)
(e) Compare and contrast sales from the shop and sales from the website.
