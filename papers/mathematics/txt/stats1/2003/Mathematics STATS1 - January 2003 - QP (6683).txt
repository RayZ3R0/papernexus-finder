Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), 
your surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions. Pages 6, 7 and 8 are blank.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

A car dealer offers purchasers a three year warranty on a new car. He sells two 
models, the Zippy and the Nifty. For the first 50 cars sold of each model the number 
of claims under the warranty is shown in the table below.
Claim
No claim
Zippy
35
15
Nifty
40
10
One of the purchasers is chosen at random. Let A be the event that no claim is made 
by the purchaser under the warranty and B the event that the car purchased is a Nifty.
(a) Find P(A ∩ B).
(2)
(b) Find P( A′ ).
(2)
Given that the purchaser chosen does not make a claim under the warranty,
(c) find the probability that the car purchased is a Zippy.
(2)
(d) Show that making a claim is not independent of the make of the car purchased.
 Comment on this result.

A drinks machine dispenses coffee into cups. A sign on the machine indicates that each cup 
contains 50 ml of coffee. The machine actually dispenses a mean amount of 55 ml per cup 
and 10% of the cups contain less than the amount stated on the sign. Assuming that the 
amount of coffee dispensed into each cup is normally distributed find
(a) the standard deviation of the amount of coffee dispensed per cup in ml,
 (4)
(b) the percentage of cups that contain more than 61 ml. 
(3)
Following complaints, the owners of the machine make adjustments. Only 2.5% of 
cups now contain less than 50 ml. The standard deviation of the amount dispensed is 
reduced to 3 ml.
Assuming that the amount of coffee dispensed is still normally distributed, 
(c) find the new mean amount of coffee per cup.

A restaurant owner is concerned about the amount of time customers have to wait 
before being served. He collects data on the waiting times, to the nearest minute, of 
20 customers. These data are listed below. 
(a) Find the median and inter-quartile range of the waiting times.
(5)
 
An outlier is an observation that falls either 1.5  × (inter-quartile range) above the 
upper quartile or 1.5 × (inter-quartile range) below the lower quartile.
(b) Draw a boxplot to represent these data, clearly indicating any outliers.
(7)
(c) Find the mean of these data. 
(2)
(d) Comment on the skewness of these data.  Justify your answer.

The chief executive of Rex cars wants to investigate the relationship between the number 
of new car sales and the amount of money spent on advertising. She collects data from 
company records on the number of new car sales, c, and the cost of advertising each year, 
p (£000). The data are shown in the table below.

(a) Using the coding  x = (p – 100) and  y = 10
1 (c – 4000),  draw a scatter diagram to 
represent these data. Explain why x is the explanatory variable.
(5)
(b) Find the equation of the least squares regression line of y on x.
[Use Σx = 402, Σy = 517, Σx2 = 17 538 and Σxy = 22 611.]
(7)
(c) Deduce the equation of the least squares regression line of  c on  p in the form 
c = a + bp.
