Candidates  may  use  any  calculator  EXCEPT  those  with  the  facility  for 
symbolic algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT 
use calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, 
Hewlett Packard HP 48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre 
number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), your 
surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions. 
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

The lifetimes of batteries used for a computer game have a mean of 12 hours and a standard 
deviation of 3 hours. Battery lifetimes may be assumed to be normally distributed.
Find the lifetime, t hours, of a battery such that 1 battery in 5 will have a lifetime longer than t.
