Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use 
calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, 
Hewlett Packard HP 48G. 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
The marks for individual questions and the parts of questions are shown in round brackets: e.g. (2). 
There are 7 questions on this paper. The total mark for this paper is 75. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

The heights of a group of athletes are modelled by a normal distribution with mean 180 cm 
and a standard deviation 5.2 cm. The weights of this group of athletes are modelled by a 
normal distribution with mean 85 kg and standard deviation 7.1 kg.  
 
 
Find the probability that a randomly chosen athlete  
 
 
(a) is taller than 188 cm,  
(3) 
 
(b) weighs less than 97 kg.  
(2) 
 
(c) Assuming that for these athletes height and weight are independent, find the probability 
that a randomly chosen athlete is taller than 188 cm and weighs more than 97 kg. 
(3) 
 
(d) Comment on the assumption that height and weight are independent.
