number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), your 
surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions. 
The total mark for this paper is 75.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.

A company assembles drills using components from two sources. Goodbuy supplies 85% of the 
components and Amart supplies the rest. It is known that 3% of the components supplied by 
Goodbuy are faulty and 6% of those supplied by Amart are faulty.
(a) Represent this information on a tree diagram.
(3)
An assembled drill is selected at random.
(b) Find the probability that it is not faulty.

(a) Find the three quartiles of these data.
(3)
During the same month, the least number of caravans on Northcliffe caravan site was 31. The 
maximum number of caravans on this site on any night that month was 72. The three quartiles 
for this site were 38, 45 and 52 respectively.
(b) On graph paper and using the same scale, draw box plots to represent the data for both 
caravan sites. You may assume that there are no outliers.
(6)
(c) Compare and contrast these two box plots.
(3)
(d) Give an interpretation to the upper quartiles of these two distributions.

(b) Write down, with a reason, whether the correlation coefficient between x and y is positive or 
negative.
(2)
The data in the table can be summarised as follows.
Σx = 1962,    Σy = 740,    Σy2 = 47 746,    Σxy = 122 783,    Sxx = 1745.
(c) Find Sxy.
(2)
The equation of the regression line of y on x is y = –106.331 + bx.
(d) Find, to 3 decimal places, the value of b.
(2)
(e) Find, to 3 significant figures, the mean y  and the standard deviation s of the weights of this 
sample of students.
(3)
(f ) Find the values of y  ± 1.96s.
(2)
(g) Comment on whether or not you think that the weights of these students could be modelled 
by a normal distribution.

Articles made on a lathe are subject to three kinds of defect, A, B or C. A sample of 1000 articles 
was inspected and the following results were obtained.
31 had a type A defect
37 had a type B defect
42 had a type C defect
11 had both type A and type B defects
13 had both type B and type C defects
10 had both type A and type C defects
  6 had all three types of defect.
(a) Draw a Venn diagram to represent these data.
(6)
Find the probability that a randomly selected article from this sample had
(b) no defects,
(1)
(c) no more than one of these defects.
(2)
An article selected at random from this sample had only one defect.
(d) Find the probability that it was a type B defect.
(2)
Two different articles were selected at random from this sample.
(e) Find the probability that both had type B defects.
