Mathematical Formulae (Lilac)
Graph Paper (ASG2)
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for
symbolic algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may
NOT use calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio
CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683),
your surname, other name and signature.
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has eight questions.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

A group of students believes that the time taken to travel to college, T minutes, can be assumed
to be normally distributed. Within the college 5% of students take at least 55 minutes to travel to
college and 0.1% take less than 10 minutes.
Find the mean and standard deviation of T.

A drilling machine can run at various speeds, but in general the higher the speed the sooner
the drill needs to be replaced. Over several months, 15 pairs of observations relating to speed,
s revolutions per minute, and life of drill, h hours, are collected.
For convenience the data are coded so that x = s – 20 and y = h – 100 and the following
summations obtained.

The distances, in kilometres, travelled to school by the teachers in two schools, A and B, in
the same town were recorded. The data for School A are summarised in Diagram 1.

Distance in kilometres
For School B, the least distance travelled was 3 km and the longest distance travelled was
55 km. The three quartiles were 17, 24 and 31 respectively.
An outlier is an observation that falls either 1.5  (interquartile range) above the upper
quartile or 1.5  (interquartile range) below the lower quartile.
(c) Draw a box plot for School B.
(5)
(d) Compare and contrast the two box plots.
