Mathematical Formulae 
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), 
your surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has 6 questions. Pages 6, 7 and 8 are blank.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

 1.
The students in a class were each asked to write down how many CDs they 
owned. The student with the least number of CDs had 14 and all but one of the 
others owned 60 or fewer. The remaining student owned 65. The quartiles for the 
class were 30, 34 and 42 respectively.
Outliers are defined to be any values outside the limits of 1.5(Q3 – Q1) below the 
lower quartile or above the upper quartile.
On graph paper draw a box plot to represent these data, indicating clearly any 
outliers.

The random variable  X is normally distributed with mean 177.0 and standard 
deviation 6.4.
(a) Find P(166 < X < 185).
      (4 marks)
It is suggested that X might be a suitable random variable to model the height, 
in cm, of adult males.
(b) Give two reasons why this is a sensible suggestion.
      (2 marks)
(c)  Explain  briefly  why  mathematical  models  can  help  to  improve  our 
understanding of real-world problems.

An employee is chosen at random.
Find the probability that this employee
(a) is an administrator,
      (2 marks)
(b) lives close to the company, given that the employee is a manager.    (2 marks)
Of the managers, 90% are married, as are 60% of the administrators and 80% of 
the production employees.
(c) Construct a tree diagram containing all the probabilities.
      (3 marks)
(d) Find the probability that an employee chosen at random is married. (3 marks)
An employee is selected at random and found to be married.
(e) Find the probability that this employee is in production.

6.
A local authority is investigating the cost of reconditioning its incinerators. Data 
from 10 randomly chosen incinerators were collected. The variables monitored 
were the operating time x (in thousands of hours) since last reconditioning and 
the reconditioning cost y (in £1000). None of the incinerators had been used for 
more than 3000 hours since last reconditioning.
The data are summarised below,
Σx = 25.0,  Σx2 = 65.68,  Σy = 50.0,  Σy2 = 260.48,  Σxy = 130.64.
(a) Find Sxx, Sxy, Syy.
      (3 marks)
(b) Calculate the product moment correlation coefficient between x and y.
(3 marks)
(c) Explain why this value might support the fitting of a linear regression model 
of the form y = a + bx.                                    
        (1 mark)
(d) Find the values of a and b.
      (4 marks)
(e) Give an interpretation of a.
        (1 mark)
(f) Estimate
(i) the reconditioning cost for an operating time of 2400 hours,
(ii) the financial effect of an increase of 1500 hours in operating time.   (4 marks)
(g) Suggest why the authority might be cautious about making a prediction of the 
reconditioning cost of an incinerator which had been operating for 4500 hours 
since its last reconditioning.
