Mathematical Formulae (Lilac)
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), 
your surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions. Pages 6, 7 and 8 are blank.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

Each of the 25 students on a computer course recorded the number of minutes x, 
to the nearest minute, spent surfing the internet during a given day. The results 
are summarised below.
Σx = 1075,  Σx2 = 44 625.
(a) Find µ and σ for these data.
            
     
(3)  
Two other students surfed the internet on the same day for 35 and 51 minutes 
respectively.
(b) Without further calculation, explain the effect on the mean of including these 
two students.

On a particular day in summer 1993 at 0800 hours the height above sea level, x 
metres, and the temperature, y °C, were recorded in 10 Mediterranean towns. The 
following summary statistics were calculated from the results.
Σx = 7300,  Σx2 = 6 599 600,  Sxy = −13 060,   Syy = 140.9.
(a) Find Sxx.
     
      (2)     
(b) Calculate, to 3 significant figures, the product moment correlation coefficient 
between x and y.

(c) Give an interpretation of your coefficient.

The continuous random variable  Y  is normally distributed with mean 100 and 
variance 256.
(a) Find P(Y < 80).
(3)
(b) Find k such that P(100 −  k ≤ Y ≤ 100 + k) = 0.5l6.

A market researcher asked 100 adults which of the three newspapers A, B, C they 
read. The results showed that 30 read A, 26 read B, 21 read C, 5 read both A 
and B, 7 read both B and C, 6 read both C and A and 2 read all three.
(a) Draw a Venn diagram to represent these data.
      (6)
One of the adults is then selected at random. 
Find the probability that she reads
(b) at least one of the newspapers,
(2)
(c) only A,
(1)
(d) only one of the newspapers,
(2)
(e) A given that she reads only one newspaper.

A music teacher monitored the sight-reading ability of one of her pupils over a 
10 week period. At the end of each week, the pupil was given a new piece to 
sight-read and the teacher noted the number of errors y. She also recorded the
