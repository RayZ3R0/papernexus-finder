Mathematical Formulae (Lilac)
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard 
HP 48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), 
your surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions. Pages 6, 7 and 8 are blank.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

An agricultural researcher collected data, in appropriate units, on the annual rainfall x and the 
annual yield of wheat y at 8 randomly selected places.
The data were coded using s = x – 6 and t = y – 20 and the following summations were obtained.
Σ s = 48.5,   Σ t = 65.0,   Σ s2 = 402.11,   Σ t 2 = 701.80,   Σ st = 523.23
(a) Find the equation of the regression line of t on s in the form t = p + qs.

(b) Find the equation of the regression line of y on x in the form y = a + bx, giving a and b to 
3 decimal places.
(3)
The value of the product moment correlation coefficient between s and t is 0.943, to 3 decimal 
places. 
(c) Write down the value of the product moment correlation coefficient between x and y. Give a 
justification for your answer.
