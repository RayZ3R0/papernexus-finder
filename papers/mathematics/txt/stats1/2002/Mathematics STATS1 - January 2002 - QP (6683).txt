Graph Paper (ASG2)
Mathematical Formulae (Lilac)
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), 
your surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions. Pages 6, 7 and 8 are blank.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

A contractor bids for two building projects. He estimates that the probability of 
winning the first project is 0.5, the probability of winning the second is 0.3 and 
the probability of winning both projects is 0.2.
(a) Find the probability that he does not win either project.
(3)
 
(b) Find the probability that he wins exactly one project.
(2)
(c) Given that he does not win the first project, find the probability that he wins 
the second.

(d) By calculation, determine whether or not winning the first contract and 
winning the second contract are independent events.

The duration of the pregnancy of a certain breed of cow is normally distributed 
with mean µ days and standard deviation σ  days. Only 2.5% of all pregnancies 
are shorter than 235 days and 15% are longer than 286 days. 
(a) Show that µ − 235 = 1.96σ .
      (2)
(b) Obtain a second equation in µ and σ .
(3)
(c) Find the value of µ and the value of σ .
