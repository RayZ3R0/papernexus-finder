Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), 
your surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions. Pages 6, 7 and 8 are blank.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

An unbiased die has faces numbered 1 to 6 inclusive. The die is rolled and the 
number that appears on the uppermost face is recorded.
(a) State the probability of not recording a 6 in one roll of the die.
             
(1)  
The die is thrown until a 6 is recorded.
(b) Find the probability that a 6 occurs for the first time on the third roll of the die. 
(3)           
2.
Statistical models can be used to describe real world problems.  Explain the process 
involved in the formulation of a statistical model. 
(4)
3.
For the events A and B,

Three companies operate a bus service along a busy main road. Amber buses run 
50% of the service and 2% of their buses are more than 5 minutes late. Blunder buses 
run 30% of the service and 10% of their buses are more than 5 minutes late. Clipper 
buses run the remainder of the service and only 1% of their buses run more than 
5 minutes late.
Jean is waiting for a bus on the main road. 
(c) Find the probability that the first bus to arrive is an Amber bus that is more than 
5 minutes late.
 (2)
Let A, B and C denote the events that Jean catches an Amber bus, a Blunder bus and a 
Clipper bus respectively. Let L denote the event that Jean catches a bus that is more 
than 5 minutes late.
(d) Draw a Venn diagram to represent the events  A, B, C and  L. Calculate the 
probabilities associated with each region and write them in the appropriate places on 
the Venn diagram.
                                                                                                                              (4)
(e) Find the probability that Jean catches a bus that is more than 5 minutes late.

A company produces electronic components which have life spans that are normally 
distributed. Only 1% of the components have a life span less than 3500 hours and 
2.5% have a life span greater than 5500 hours. 
(b) Determine the mean and standard deviation of the life spans of the components.

use. Give a reason for your answer. 
                                                                                                                              (2)

An ice cream seller believes that there is a relationship between the temperature on a 
summer day and the number of ice creams sold. Over a period of 10 days he records 
the temperature at 1p.m., t °C, and the number of ice creams sold, c, in the next hour. 
The data he collects is summarised in the table below.

(a) Calculate the value of the product moment correlation coefficient between t and c. 
(7)
(b) State whether or not your value supports the use of a regression equation to 
predict the number of ice creams sold. Give a reason for your answer.                       (2)
(c) Find the equation of the least squares regression line of  c on  t  in the form 
c = a + bt. 
 (2)
(d) Interpret the value of b. 
 (1)
(e) Estimate the number of ice creams sold between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. when the 
temperature at 1 p.m. is 16 °C.
(3)
(f) At 1 p.m. on a particular day, the highest temperature for 50 years was recorded. 
Give a reason why you should not use the regression equation to predict ice cream 
sales on that day.
