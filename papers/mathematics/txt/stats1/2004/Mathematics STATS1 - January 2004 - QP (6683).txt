Mathematical Formulae (Lilac)
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), 
your surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has six questions. 
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

(a) Draw a histogram to represent these data.
      (5)
(b) Use interpolation to estimate the median and inter-quartile range of daily sales. 
(5)
(c) Estimate the mean and the standard deviation of these data. 
(6)
The newsagent wants to compare last year’s sales with other years. 
(d) State whether the newsagent should use the median and the inter-quartile range or the mean and the 
standard deviation to compare daily sales. Give a reason for your answer.

One of the objectives of a computer game is to collect keys. There are three stages to the game. The probability 
of collecting a key at the first stage is 3

(a) Draw a tree diagram to represent the 3 stages of the game. 
(4)
(b) Find the probability of collecting all 3 keys.
(2)
(c) Find the probability of collecting exactly one key in a game.
(5)
(d) Calculate the probability that keys are not collected on at least 2 successive stages in a game.
