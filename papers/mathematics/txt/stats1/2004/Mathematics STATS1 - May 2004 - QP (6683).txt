Candidates  may  use  any  calculator  EXCEPT  those  with  the  facility  for 
symbolic algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT 
use calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, 
Hewlett Packard HP 48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre 
number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), your 
surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has six questions. 
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

A fair die has six faces numbered 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 and 3. The die is rolled twice and the number 
showing on the uppermost face is recorded each time.
Find the probability that the sum of the two numbers recorded is at least 5.

A researcher thinks there is a link between a person's height and level of confidence. She measured 
the height h, to the nearest cm, of a random sample of 9 people. She also devised a test to measure 
the level of confidence c of each person. The data are shown in the table below.

A health club lets members use, on each visit, its facilities for as long as they wish. The club’s 
records suggest that the length of a visit can be modelled by a normal distribution with mean  
90 minutes. Only 20% of members stay for more than 125 minutes.
(a) Find the standard deviation of the normal distribution.
(4)
(b) Find the probability that a visit lasts less than 25 minutes.
(3)
The club introduce a closing time of 10:00 pm. Tara arrives at the club at 8:00 pm.
(c) Explain whether or not this normal distribution is still a suitable model for the length of her 
visit.
