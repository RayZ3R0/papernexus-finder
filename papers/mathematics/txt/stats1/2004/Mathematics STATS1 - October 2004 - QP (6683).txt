Mathematical Formulae (Lilac)
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility 
for  symbolic  algebra,  differentiation  and/or  integration.  Thus 
candidates may NOT use calculators such as the Texas Instruments 
TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre 
number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S1), the paper reference (6683), your 
surname, other name and signature.
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions. 
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

An experiment carried out by a student yielded pairs of (x, y) observations such that
x  = 36,   y  = 28.6,   Sxx = 4402,   Sxy = 3477.6
(a) Calculate the equation of the regression line of y on x in the form y = a + bx. Give your 
values of a and b to 2 decimal places.

The random variable X ∼ N(µ, σ 2).
It is known that
P(X ≤ 66) = 0.0359   and   P(X ≥ 81) = 0.1151.
(a) In the space below, give a clearly labelled sketch to represent these probabilities on a 
Normal curve.

Show that the value of σ is 5.
(ii) Find the value of µ.

Students in Mr Brawn’s exercise class have to do press-ups and sit-ups. The number of press-ups 
x and the number of sit-ups y done by a random sample of 8 students are summarised below.
Σx = 272,
Σx2 = 10 164,       Σxy = 11 222,
Σy = 320,
Σy2 = 13 464.
(a) Evaluate Sxx, Syy and Sxy.
(4)
(b) Calculate, to 3 decimal places, the product moment correlation coefficient between x and y.
(3)
(c) Give an interpretation of your coefficient.
(2)
(d) Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the number of press-ups done by these 
students.
(4)
Mr Brawn assumes that the number of press-ups that can be done by any student can be 
modelled by a normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ. Assuming that µ and σ 
take the same values as those calculated in part (d),
(e) find the value of a such that P(µ – a < X < µ + a) = 0.95.

(f) Comment on Mr Brawn’s assumption of normality.
