Mathematical Formulae (Lilac)
Graph Paper (ASG2)
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for
symbolic algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may
NOT use calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI-89, TI-92,
Casio CFX-9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre
number, candidate number, the unit title (Pure Mathematics C4), the paper reference (6666), your
surname, other name and signature.
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has eight questions.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers without
working may gain no credit.
