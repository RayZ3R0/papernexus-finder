Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for 
symbolic algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT 
use calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, 
Hewlett Packard HP 48G. 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre 
number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S2), the paper reference (6684), your 
surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions.  
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

1. 
Explain briefly what you understand by  
 
(a) a statistic, 
(2) 
(b) a sampling distribution.

2. 
(a) Write down the condition needed to approximate a Poisson distribution by a Normal 
distribution. 
(1) 
 
The random variable Y ~ Po(30). 
 
(b) Estimate P(Y > 28).

3. 
In a town, 30% of residents listen to the local radio station. Four residents are chosen at random. 
 
(a) State the distribution of the random variable X, the number of these four residents that listen 
to local radio. 
(2) 
(b) On graph paper, draw the probability distribution of X. 
(3) 
(c) Write down the most likely number of these four residents that listen to the local radio 
station. 
(1) 
(d) Find E(X) and Var (X). 
(3) 
 
 
4. 
(a) Write down the conditions under which the binomial distribution may be a suitable model to 
use in statistical work. 
(4) 
 
 
A six-sided die is biased. When the die is thrown the number 5 is twice as likely to appear as any 
other number. All the other faces are equally likely to appear. The die is thrown repeatedly. 
 
 
Find the probability that 
 
 
(b) (i)  the first 5 will occur on the sixth throw, 
 
 
 
(ii) in the first eight throws there will be exactly three 5s.

A drinks machine dispenses lemonade into cups. It is electronically controlled to cut off the flow 
of lemonade randomly between 180 ml and 200 ml. The random variable X is the volume of 
lemonade dispensed into a cup. 
 
(a) Specify the probability density function of X and sketch its graph. 
(4) 
(b) Find the probability that the machine dispenses 
 
 
(i) less than 183 ml, 
 
 
(ii) exactly 183 ml. 
(3) 
(c) Calculate the inter-quartile range of X. 
(1) 
(d) Determine the value of x such that P(X ≥ x) = 2P(X ≤ x). 
(3) 
(e) Interpret in words your value of x. 
(2) 
 
6. 
A doctor expects to see, on average, 1 patient per week with a particular disease. 
 
(a) Suggest a suitable model for the distribution of the number of times per week that the doctor 
sees a patient with the disease. Give a reason for your answer. 
(3) 
(b) Using your model, find the probability that the doctor sees more than 3 patients with the 
disease in a 4 week period. 
(4) 
 
The doctor decides to send information to his patients to try to reduce the number of patients he 
sees with the disease. In the first 6 weeks after the information is sent out, the doctor sees 
2 patients with the disease. 
 
(c) Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not there is reason to believe that sending 
the information has reduced the number of times the doctor sees patients with the disease. 
State your hypotheses clearly. 
 
(6) 
 
Medical research into the nature of the disease discovers that it can be passed from one patient to 
another. 
 
(d) Explain whether or not this research supports your choice of model. Give a reason for your 
answer.
