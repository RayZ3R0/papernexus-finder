Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for 
symbolic algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT 
use calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, 
Hewlett Packard HP 48G. 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre 
number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S2), the paper reference (6684), your 
surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has six questions.  
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

1. 
An engineer measures, to the nearest cm, the lengths of metal rods. 
 
 
(a) Suggest a suitable model to represent the difference between the true lengths and the 
measured lengths. 
(2) 
 
(b) Find the probability that for a randomly chosen rod the measured length will be within 
0.2 cm of the true length. 
(2) 
 
 
Two rods are chosen at random. 
 
 (c) Find the probability that for both rods the measured lengths will be within 0.2 cm of their 
true lengths.

A single observation x is to be taken from a Poisson distribution with parameter λ. This 
observation is to be used to test H0 : λ = 7 against H1 : λ ≠ 7. 
 
 (a) Using a 5% significance level, find the critical region for this test assuming that the 
probability of rejection in either tail is as close as possible to 2.5%. 
(5) 
 
(b) Write down the significance level of this test. 
(1) 
 
 
The actual value of x obtained was 5. 
 
 
(c) State a conclusion that can be drawn based on this value. 
(2) 
 
 
3. 
A botanist suggests that the number of a particular variety of weed growing in a meadow can be 
modelled by a Poisson distribution. 
 
 
(a) Write down two conditions that must apply for this model to be applicable. 
(2) 
 
 
Assuming this model and a mean of 0.7 weeds per m2, find 
 
 
(b) the probability that in a randomly chosen plot of size 4 m2 there will be fewer than 3 of these 
weeds. 
(4) 
(c) Using a suitable approximation, find the probability that in a plot of 100 m2 there will be 
more than 66 of these weeds.

A farmer noticed that some of the eggs laid by his hens had double yolks. He estimated the 
probability of this happening to be 0.05. Eggs are packed in boxes of 12. 
 
 
Find the probability that in a box, the number of eggs with double yolks will be  
 
 
(a) exactly one, 
 
(3) 
 
(b) more than three. 
 
(2) 
 
A customer bought three boxes. 
 
 
(c) Find the probability that only 2 of the boxes contained exactly 1 egg with a double yolk. 
 
(3) 
The farmer delivered 10 boxes to a local shop. 
 
(d) Using a suitable approximation, find the probability that the delivery contained at least 
9 eggs with double yolks. 
(4) 
 
The weight of an individual egg can be modelled by a normal distribution with mean 65 g and 
standard deviation 2.4 g. 
 
(e) Find the probability that a randomly chosen egg weighs more than 68 g.

A magazine has a large number of subscribers who each pay a membership fee that is due on 
January 1st each year. Not all subscribers pay their fee by the due date. Based on correspondence 
from the subscribers, the editor of the magazine believes that 40% of subscribers wish to change 
the name of the magazine. Before making this change the editor decides to carry out a sample 
survey to obtain the opinions of the subscribers. He uses only those members who have paid 
their fee on time. 
 
 
(a) Define the population associated with the magazine. 
(1) 
 
(b) Suggest a suitable sampling frame for the survey. 
(1) 
 
(c) Identify the sampling units. 
(1) 
(d) Give one advantage and one disadvantage that would have resulted from the editor using a 
census rather than a sample survey. 
(2) 
 
As a pilot study the editor took a random sample of 25 subscribers. 
 
(e) Assuming that the editor’s belief is correct, find the probability that exactly 10 of these 
subscribers agreed with changing the name. 
(3)  
In fact only 6 subscribers agreed to the name being changed. 
 
(f) Stating your hypotheses clearly test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not the 
percentage agreeing to the change is less that the editor believes. 
(5) 
 
The full survey is to be carried out using 200 randomly chosen subscribers. 
 
(g) Again assuming the editor’s belief to be correct and using a suitable approximation, find the 
probability that in this sample there will be least 71 but fewer than 83 subscribers who agree 
to the name being changed.
