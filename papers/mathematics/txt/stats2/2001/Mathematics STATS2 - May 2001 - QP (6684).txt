Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard 
HP 48G. 
 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S2), the paper reference (6684), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions. Pages 6, 7 and 8 are blank. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

 1. 
The small village of Tornep has a preservation society which is campaigning for 
a new by-pass to be built. The society needs to measure 
 
(i) the strength of opinion amongst the residents of Tornep for the scheme and  
(ii) the flow of traffic through the village on weekdays. 
 
The society wants to know whether to use a census or a sample survey for each of 
these measures. 
 
(a) In each case suggest which they should use and specify a suitable sampling 
frame.  
(4) 
For the measurement of traffic flow through Tornep, 
 
(b) suggest a suitable statistic and a possible statistical model for this statistic.

2. 
On a stretch of motorway accidents occur at a rate of 0.9 per month. 
 
(a) Show that the probability of no accidents in the next month is 0.407, to 
3 significant figures. 
(1)  
Find the probability of 
(b) exactly 2 accidents in the next 6 month period, 
(3) 
(c) no accidents in exactly 2 of the next 4 months.

In a sack containing a large number of beads 
4
1  are coloured gold and the 
remainder are of different colours. A group of children use some of the beads in a 
craft lesson and do not replace them. Afterwards the teacher wishes to know 
whether or not the proportion of gold beads left in the sack has changed. He 
selects a random sample of 20 beads and finds that 2 of them are coloured gold. 
 
Stating your hypotheses clearly test, at the 10% level of significance, whether or 
not there is evidence that the proportion of gold beads has changed.

A company always sends letters by second class post unless they are marked first 
class. Over a long period of time it has been established that 20% of letters to be 
posted are marked first class. 
 
In a random selection of 10 letters to be posted, find the probability that the 
number marked first class is 
 
(a) at least 3, 
(2) 
(b) fewer than 2. 
(2) 
One Monday morning there are only 12 first class stamps. Given that there are 70 
letters to be posted that day, 
 
(c) use a suitable approximation to find the probability that there are enough first 
class stamps. 
(7)  
(d) State an assumption about these 70 letters that is required in order to make    
the calculation in part (c) valid.

5. 
The maintenance department of a college receives requests for replacement light 
bulbs at a rate of 2 per week. 
 
Find the probability that in a randomly chosen week the number of requests for 
replacement light bulbs is 
 
(a) exactly 4, 
(2) 
(b) more than 5. 
(2) 
Three weeks before the end of term the maintenance department discovers that 
there are only 5 light bulbs left. 
 
(c) Find the probability that the department can meet all requests for replacement 
light bulbs before the end of term. 
(3) 
The following term the principal of the college announces a package of new 
measures to reduce the amount of damage to college property. In the first 4 weeks 
following this announcement, 3 requests for replacement light bulbs are received. 
 
(d) Stating your hypotheses clearly test, at the 5% level of significance, whether 
or not there is evidence that the rate of requests for replacement light bulbs has 
decreased.

In a computer game, a star moves across the screen, with constant speed, taking 
1 s to travel from one side to the other. The player can stop the star by pressing a 
key. The object of the game is to stop the star in the middle of the screen by 
pressing the key exactly 0.5 s after the star first appears. Given that the player 
actually presses the key T s after the star first appears, a simple model of the 
game assumes that T is a continuous uniform random variable defined over the 
interval [0, 1]. 
 
(a) Write down P(T < 0.2). 
(1) 
(b) Write down E(T). 
(1) 
(c) Use integration to find Var(T). 
(4) 
A group of 20 children each play this game once. 
 
(d) Find the probability that no more than 4 children stop the star in less 
than 0.2 s.  
(3) 
The children are allowed to practise.this game so that this continuous uniform 
model is no longer applicable. 
 
(e) Explain how you would expect the mean and variance of T to change. 
(2) 
It is found that a more appropriate model of the game when played by 
experienced players assumes that T has a probability density function g(t) given 
by

stop the star in less than 0.2 s.
