Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use 
calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, 
Hewlett Packard HP 48G. 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S2), the paper reference (6684), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
The marks for individual questions and the parts of questions are shown in round brackets: e.g. (2). 
There are 7 questions on this paper. The total mark for this paper is 75. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

7. 
A teacher thinks that 20% of the pupils in a school read the Deano comic regularly. 
 
 
He chooses 20 pupils at random and finds 9 of them read the Deano.  
 
 
(a) (i) Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not there is evidence that the 
percentage of pupils that read the Deano is different from 20%. State your 
hypotheses clearly. 
 
 
 
(ii) State all the possible numbers of pupils that read the Deano from a sample of size 20 
that will make the test in part (a)(i) significant at the 5% level.  
(9) 
 
 
The teacher takes another 4 random samples of size 20 and they contain 1, 3, 1 and 4 pupils 
that read the Deano. 
 
 
(b) By combining all 5 samples and using a suitable approximation test, at the 5% level of 
significance, whether or not this provides evidence that the percentage of pupils in the 
school that read the Deano is different from 20%.  
(8) 
 
(c) Comment on your results for the tests in part (a) and part (b).
