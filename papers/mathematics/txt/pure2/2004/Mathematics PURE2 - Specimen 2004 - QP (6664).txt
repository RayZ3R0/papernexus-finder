The shaded area in Fig. 1 shows a badge ABC, where AB and AC are straight lines, 
with AB = AC = 8 mm. The curve BC is an arc of a circle, centre O, where OB = OC = 
8 mm and O is in the same plane as ABC. The angle BAC is 0.9 radians.

(a) Show that at the start of the year 2002, the value of the machine was £9600. (2) 
 
When the value of the machine falls below £500, the company will replace it. 
 
(b) Find the year in which the machine will be replaced.  
 
(4) 
 
To plan for a replacement machine, the company pays £1000 at the start of each year 
into a savings account. The account pays interest at a fixed rate of 5% per annum. The 
first payment was made when the machine was first bought and the last payment will 
be made at the start of the year in which the machine is replaced. 
 
(c) Using your answer to part (b), find how much the savings account will be worth 
immediately after the payment at the start of the year in which the machine is 
replaced.
