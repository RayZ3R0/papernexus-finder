A uniform rod AB, of length 8a and weight W, is free to rotate in a vertical plane about a 
smooth pivot at A. One end of a light inextensible string is attached to B. The other end is 
attached to point C which is vertically above A, with AC = 6a. The rod is in equilibrium with 
AB horizontal, as shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
(a) By taking moments about A, or otherwise, show that the tension in the string is 6

(b) Calculate the magnitude of the horizontal component of the force exerted by the pivot on 
the rod.

A small package P is modelled as a particle of mass 0.6 kg. The package slides down a rough 
plane from a point S to a point T, where ST = 12 m. The plane is inclined at an angle of 30° to 
the horizontal and ST is a line of greatest slope of the plane, as shown in Figure 3. The speed 
of P at S is 10 m s–1 and the speed of P at T is 9 m s–1. Calculate  
 
 
(a) the total loss of energy of P in moving from S to T, 
(4) 
 
(b) the coefficient of friction between P and the plane.

A particle P of mass 0.4 kg is moving under the action of a single force F newtons. At time 
t seconds, the velocity of P, v m s–1, is given by 
 
v = (6t + 4)i + (t2 + 3t)j. 
 
 
When t = 0, P is at the point with position vector (–3i + 4j) m. When t = 4, P is at the point S. 
 
 
(a) Calculate the magnitude of F when t = 4.

A car of mass 1000 kg is towing a trailer of mass 1500 kg along a straight horizontal road. 
The tow-bar joining the car to the trailer is modelled as a light rod parallel to the road. The 
total resistance to motion of the car is modelled as having constant magnitude 750 N. The 
total resistance to motion of the trailer is modelled as of magnitude R newtons, where R is a 
constant. When the engine of the car is working at a rate of 50 kW, the car and the trailer 
travel at a constant speed of 25 m s–1. 
 
 
(a) Show that R = 1250. 
(3) 
 
 
When travelling at 25 m s–1 the driver of the car disengages the engine and applies the brakes. 
The brakes provide a constant braking force of magnitude 1500 N to the car. The resisting 
forces of magnitude 750 N and 1250 N are assumed to remain unchanged. Calculate 
 
 
 
(b) the deceleration of the car while braking, 
(3) 
 
(c) the thrust in the tow-bar while braking, 
(2) 
 
(d) the work done, in kJ, by the braking force in bringing the car and the trailer to rest. 
(4) 
 
(e) Suggest how the modelling assumption that the resistances to motion are constant could 
be refined to be more realistic.

A particle P of mass 3m is moving with speed 2u in a straight line on a smooth horizontal 
table. The particle P collides with a particle Q of mass 2m moving with speed u in the 
opposite direction to P. The coefficient of restitution between P and Q is e. 
 
 
(a) Show that the speed of Q after the collision is 5
1 u(9e + 4). 
(5) 
 
 
As a result of the collision, the direction of motion of P is reversed. 
 
 
(b) Find the range of possible values of e.

Given that the magnitude of the impulse of P on Q is 5
