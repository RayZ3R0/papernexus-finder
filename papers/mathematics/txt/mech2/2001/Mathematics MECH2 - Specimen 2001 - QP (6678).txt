Mathematical Formulae (Lilac)
Graph Paper (ASG2)
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use
calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G,
Hewlett Packard HP 48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M2), the paper reference (6678),
your surname, other name and signature.
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s2.
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has eight questions.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

The vectors i and j are perpendicular unit vectors in a horizontal plane.  A ball of mass 0.5 kg is
moving with velocity –20i m s1 when it is struck by a bat. The bat gives the ball an impulse of
(15i + 10j) Ns.  
Find, to 3 significant figures, the speed of the ball immediately after it has been struck.

A bullet of mass 6 grams passes horizontally through a fixed, vertical board.  After the bullet has
travelled 2 cm through the board its speed is reduced from 400 m s1 to 250 m s1.  The board
exerts a constant resistive force on the bullet.  
Find, to 3 significant figures, the magnitude of this resistive force.

A uniform ladder, of mass m and length 2a, has one end on rough horizontal ground.  The other
end rests against a smooth vertical wall. A man of mass 3m stands at the top of the ladder and
the ladder is in equilibrium. The coefficient of friction between the ladder and the ground is 4

and the ladder makes an angle α with the vertical, as shown in Fig. 1. The ladder is in a vertical
plane perpendicular to the wall.
