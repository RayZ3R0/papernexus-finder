Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard 
HP 48G. 
 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M2), the paper reference (6678), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s−2. 
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions.  Pages 6,7 and 8 are blank. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

A particle P moves on the x-axis. At time t seconds the velocity of P is v m s−1 in the direction of 
x increasing, where v = 6t – 2t2. When 
0
t =

when P comes to instantaneous rest after leaving O.

A girl and her bicycle have a combined mass of 64 kg. She cycles up a straight stretch of road 
which is inclined at an angle α to the horizontal, where 
1
14
sinα =
. She cycles at a constant speed 
of 5 m s−1. When she is cycling at this speed, the resistance to motion from non-gravitational 
forces has magnitude 20 N. 
 
(a) Find the rate at which the cyclist is working. 
(4) 
 
She now turns round and comes down the same road. Her initial speed is 
1
5 m s−, and the 
resistance to motion is modelled as remaining constant with magnitude 20 N. She free-wheels 
down the road for a distance of 80 m. Using this model, 
 
(b) find the speed of the cyclist when she has travelled a distance of 80 m. 
(5) 
 
The cyclist again moves down the same road, but this time she pedals down the road. The 
resistance is now modelled as having magnitude proportional to the speed of the cyclist. Her 
initial speed is again 5 m s−1 when the resistance to motion has magnitude 20 N. 
 
(c) Find the magnitude of the resistance to motion when the speed of the cyclist is 
1
8 m s−. 
 
(1) 
 
The cyclist works at a constant rate of 200 W. 
 
(d) Find the magnitude of her acceleration when her speed is 
1
8 m s−.

A uniform sphere A of mass m is moving with speed u on a smooth horizontal table when it 
collides directly with another uniform sphere B of mass 2m which is at rest on the table. The 
spheres are of equal radius and the coefficient of restitution between them is e. The direction of 
motion of A is unchanged by the collision. 
 
(a) Find the speeds of A and B immediately after the collision. 
(7) 
(b) Find the range of possible values of e. 
(2) 
 
After being struck by A, the sphere B collides directly with another sphere C, of mass 4m  and of 
the same size as B. The sphere C is at rest on the table immediately before being struck by B. The 
coefficient of restitution between B and C is also e. 
 
(c) Show that, after B has struck C, there will be a further collision between A and B.
