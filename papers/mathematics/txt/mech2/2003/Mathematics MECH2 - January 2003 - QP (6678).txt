Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard

Three particles of mass 3m, 5m and λm are placed at points with coordinates (4, 0), (0, −3) and

A car of mass 1000 kg is moving along a straight horizontal road with a constant acceleration 
of f m s−2. The resistance to motion is modelled as a constant force of magnitude 1200 N. When 
the car is travelling at 12 m s−1, the power generated by the engine of the car is 24 kW.  
 
(a) Calculate the value of f.  
 
 
 
                   (4) 
 
 
When the car is travelling at 14 m s−1, the engine is switched off and the car comes to rest, 
without braking, in a distance of d metres. Assuming the same model for resistance,   
 
 
(b) use the work-energy principle to calculate the value of d. 
(3) 
 
(c) Give a reason why the model used for the resistance to motion may not be realistic.

A uniform ladder AB, of mass m and length 2a, has one end A on rough horizontal ground. The 
other end B rests against a smooth vertical wall. The ladder is in a vertical plane perpendicular to 
the wall. The ladder makes an angle α with the horizontal, where tan α = 3
4 . A child of mass 2m 
stands on the ladder at C where AC = 2
1 a, as shown in Fig. 1. The ladder and the child are in 
equilibrium. 
 
By modelling the ladder as a rod and the child as a particle, calculate the least possible value of 
the coefficient of friction between the ladder and the ground.

A particle P moves on the x-axis. The acceleration of P at time t seconds is (4t – 8) m s−2, 
measured in the direction of x increasing. The velocity of P at time t seconds is v m s−1. Given 
that v = 6 when t = 0, find

A smooth sphere P of mass 2m is moving in a straight line with speed u on a smooth horizontal 
table. Another smooth sphere Q of mass m is at rest on the table. The sphere P collides directly 
with Q. The coefficient of restitution between P and Q is 3
1 . The spheres are modelled as 
particles. 
 
(a) Show that, immediately after the collision, the speeds of P and Q are 
9

9
8 u 
respectively.  
(7) 
 
After the collision, Q strikes a fixed vertical wall which is perpendicular to the direction of 
motion of P and Q. The coefficient of restitution between Q and the wall is e. When P and Q 
collide again, P is brought to rest. 
 
(b) Find the value of e. 
(7) 
(c)  Explain why there must be a third collision between P and Q.

A ball B of mass 0.4 kg is struck by a bat at a point O which is 1.2 m above horizontal ground. 
The unit vectors i and j are respectively horizontal and vertical. Immediately before being struck, 
B has velocity (−20i + 4j) m s−1. Immediately after being struck it has velocity (15i + 16j) m s−1.  
 
After B has been struck, it moves freely under gravity and strikes the ground at the point A, as 
shown in Fig. 3. The ball is modelled as a particle. 
 
(a) Calculate the magnitude of the impulse exerted by the bat on B. 
(4) 
(b) By using the principle of conservation of energy, or otherwise, find the speed of B when it 
reaches A.  
(6) 
(c) Calculate the angle which the velocity of B makes with the ground when B reaches A. 
(4) 
(d) State two additional physical factors which could be taken into account in a refinement of 
the model of the situation which would make it more realistic.
