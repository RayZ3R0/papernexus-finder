Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard 
HP 48G. 
 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M2), the paper reference (6678), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s−2. 
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions. Pages 7 and 8 are blank. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

 1. 
A particle of mass 4 kg is moving in a straight horizontal line. There is a constant 
resistive force of magnitude R newtons. The speed of the particle is reduced from 
25 m s−1 to rest over a distance of 200 m.  
 
Use the work-energy principle to calculate the value of R. 
(4)       
 
2. 
A van of mass 1500 kg is driving up a straight road inclined at an angle α to the 
horizontal, where sin α = 12
1 . The resistance to motion due to non-gravitational 
forces is modelled as a constant force of magnitude 1000 N. 
 
Given that initially the speed of the van is 30 m s−1 and that the van’s engine is 
working at a rate of 60 kW, 
 
 (a) calculate the magnitude of the initial decleration of the van. 
(4) 
When travelling up the same hill, the rate of working of the van’s engine is 
increased to 80 kW. Using the same model for the resistance due to non-
gravitational forces, 
 
(b) calculate in m s−1 the constant speed which can be sustained by the van at this 
rate of working. 
(4) 
(c) Give one reason why the use of this model for resistance may mean that your 
answer to part (b) is too high.

3.  
A particle P of mass 0.3 kg is moving under the action of a single force 
F newtons. At time t seconds the velocity of P, v m s−1, is given by 
 
v = 3t2i + (6t – 4)j. 
 
(a) Calculate, to 3 significant figures, the magnitude of F when t = 2.  
(5) 
When t = 0, P is at the point A. The position vector of A with respect to a fixed 
origin O is (3i – 4j) m. When t = 4, P is at the point B.  
 
(b) Find the position vector of B.

Figure 1 shows a template made by removing a square WXYZ from a uniform 
triangular lamina ABC. The lamina is isosceles with CA = CB and AB = 12a. The 
mid-point of AB is N and NC = 8a. The centre O of the square lies on NC and 
ON = 2a. The sides WX and ZY are parallel to AB and WZ = 2a. The centre of 
mass of the template is at G.

The template has mass M. A small metal stud of mass kM is attached to the 
template at C. The centre of mass of the combined template and stud lies on YZ.

Figure 2 shows a horizontal uniform pole AB, of weight W and length 2a. The 
end A of the pole rests against a rough vertical wall. One end of a light 
inextensible string BD is attached to the pole at B and the other end is attached to 
the wall at D. A particle of weight 2W is attached to the pole at C, where BC = x. 
The pole is in equilibrium in a vertical plane perpendicular to the wall. The string 
BD is inclined at an angle θ to the horizontal, where sin θ = 5

modelled as a uniform rod.

A smooth sphere P of mass m is moving in a straight line with speed u on a 
smooth horizontal table. Another smooth sphere Q of mass 2m is at rest on the 
table. The sphere P collides directly with Q. After the collision the direction of 
motion of P is unchanged. The spheres have the same radii and the coefficient of 
restitution between P and Q is e. By modelling the spheres as particles, 
 
(a) show that the speed of Q immediately after the collision is 3

A rocket R of mass 100 kg is projected from a point A with speed 80 m s−1 at an 
angle of elevation of 60°, as shown in Fig. 3. The point A is 20 m vertically above 
a point O which is on horizontal ground. The rocket R moves freely under 
gravity. At B the velocity of R is horizontal. By modelling R as a particle, find 
 
(a) the height in m of B above the ground,  
(4) 
(b) the time taken for R to reach B from A.   
(2) 
When R is at B, there is an internal explosion and R breaks into two parts P and Q 
of masses 60 kg and 40 kg respectively. Immediately after the explosion the 
velocity of P is 80 m s−1 horizontally away from A. After the explosion the paths 
of P and Q remain in the plane OAB. Part Q strikes the ground at C. By 
modelling P and Q as particles,  
 
(c) show that the speed of Q immediately after the explosion is 20 m s−1, 
(3) 
(d) find the distance OC.
