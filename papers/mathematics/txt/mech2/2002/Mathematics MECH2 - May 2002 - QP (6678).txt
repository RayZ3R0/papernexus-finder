Figure 1 shows the path taken by a cyclist in travelling on a section of a road. When 
the cyclist comes to the point A on the top of a hill, she is travelling at 8 m s−1. She 
descends a vertical distance of 20 m to the bottom of the hill. The road then rises to 
the point B through a vertical distance of 12 m. When she reaches B, her speed is 
5 m s−1. The total mass of the cyclist and the cycle is 80 kg and the total distance 
along the road from A to B is 500 m. By modelling the resistance to the motion of the 
cyclist as of constant magnitude 20 N, 
 
(a) find the work done by the cyclist in moving from A to B. 
(5) 
At B the road is horizontal. Given that at B the cyclist is accelerating at 0.5 m s−2, 
 
(b) find the power generated by the cyclist at B.

A particle is projected from a point with speed u at an angle of elevation α above the 
horizontal and moves freely under gravity. When it has moved a horizontal distance 
x, its height above the point of projection is y.

A shot-putter puts a shot from a point A at a height of 2 m above horizontal ground. 
The shot is projected at an angle of elevation of 45° with a speed of 14 m s−1. By 
modelling the shot as a particle moving freely under gravity, 
 
(b) find, to 3 significant figures, the horizontal distance of the shot from A when the 
shot hits the ground,

A small smooth ball A of mass m is moving on a horizontal table with speed u when it 
collides directly with another small smooth ball B of mass 3m which is at rest on the 
table. The balls have the same radius and the coefficient of restitution between the 
balls is e. The direction of motion of A is reversed as a result of the collision. 
 
(a) Find, in terms of e and u. the speeds of A and B immediately after the collision. 
(7) 
 
In the subsequent motion B strikes a vertical wall, which is perpendicular to the 
direction of motion of B, and rebounds. The coefficient of restitution between B and 
the wall is 4
3 . 
 
Given that there is a second collision between A and B, 
 
(b) find the range of values of e for which the motion described is possible.

A straight log AB has weight W and length 2a. A cable is attached to one end B of the 
log. The cable lifts the end B off the ground. The end A remains in contact with the 
ground, which is rough and horizontal. The log is in limiting equilibrium. The log 
makes an angle α to the horizontal, where tan α = 12
5 . The cable makes an angle β to 
the horizontal, as shown in Fig. 3. The coefficient of friction between the log and the 
ground is 0.6. The log is modelled as a uniform rod and the cable as light.
