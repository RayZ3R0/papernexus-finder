Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s−2. 
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
The marks for individual questions and the parts of questions are shown in round brackets: e.g. (2).

A brick of mass 3 kg slides in a straight line on a horizontal floor. The brick is modelled as a 
particle and the floor as a rough plane. The initial speed of the brick is 8 m s–1. The brick is 
brought to rest after moving 12 m by the constant frictional force between the brick and the 
floor. 
 
 
(a) Calculate the kinetic energy lost by the brick in coming to rest, stating the units of your 
answer. 
(2) 
 
(b) Calculate the coefficient of friction between the brick and the floor.

A particle P of mass 0.4 kg is moving so that its position vector r metres at time t seconds is 
given by 
 
r = (t2 + 4t)i + (3t – t3)j. 
 
 
(a) Calculate the speed of P when t = 3.

When t = 3, the particle P is given an impulse (8i – 12j) N s.

A car of mass 1000 kg is moving along a straight horizontal road. The resistance to motion is 
modelled as a constant force of magnitude R newtons. The engine of the car is working at a 
rate of 12 kW. When the car is moving with speed 15 m s–1, the acceleration of the car 
is 0.2 m s–2.  
 
 
(a) Show that R = 600.  
(4) 
 
 
The car now moves with constant speed U m s–1 downhill on a straight road inclined at θ to 
the horizontal, where sin θ = 40
1 . The engine of the car is now working at a rate of 7 kW. The 
resistance to motion from non-gravitational forces remains of magnitude R newtons.  
 
 
(c) Calculate the value of U.

A particle A of mass 2m is moving with speed 3u in a straight line on a smooth horizontal 
table. The particle collides directly with a particle B of mass m moving with speed 2u in the 
opposite direction to A. Immediately after the collision the speed of B is 3
8 u and the direction 
of motion of B is reversed. 
 
 
(a) Calculate the coefficient of restitution between A and B. 
(6) 
 
(b) Show that the kinetic energy lost in the collision is 7mu2.

After the collision B strikes a fixed vertical wall that is perpendicular to the direction of 
motion of B. The magnitude of the impulse of the wall on B is 3
14 mu. 
 
(c) Calculate the coefficient of restitution between B and the wall.

A ladder AB, of weight W and length 4a, has one end A on rough horizontal ground. The 
coefficient of friction between the ladder and the ground is µ. The other end B rests against a 
smooth vertical wall. The ladder makes an angle θ with the horizontal, where tan θ = 2. A load 
of weight 4W is placed at the point C on the ladder, where AC = 3a, as shown in Figure 2. The 
ladder is modelled as a uniform rod which is in a vertical plane perpendicular to the wall. The 
load is modelled as a particle. Given that the system is in limiting equilibrium, 
 
 
(a) show that µ = 0.35. 
(6) 
 
 
A second load of weight kW is now placed on the ladder at A. The load of weight 4W is 
removed from C and placed on the ladder at B. The ladder is modelled as a uniform rod which 
is in a vertical plane perpendicular to the wall. The loads are modelled as particles. Given that 
the ladder and the loads are in equilibrium, 
 
 
(b) find the range of possible values of k.

The object of a game is to throw a ball B from a point A to hit a target T which is placed at the 
top of a vertical pole, as shown in Figure 3. The point A is 1 m above horizontal ground and 
the height of the pole is 2 m. The pole is at a horizontal distance of 10 m from A. The ball B is 
projected from A with a speed of 11 m s–1 at an angle of elevation of 30°. The ball hits the 
pole at the point C. The ball B and the target T are modelled as particles. 
 
 
(a) Calculate, to 2 decimal places, the time taken for B to move from A to C.  
(3) 
 
(b) Show that C is approximately 0.63 m below T.  
(4) 
 
 
The ball is thrown again from A. The speed of projection of B is increased to V m s–1, the 
angle of elevation remaining 30°. This time B hits T.  
 
 
(c) Calculate the value of V. 
(6) 
 
(d) Explain why, in practice, a range of values of V would result in B hitting the target.
