Candidates may use any calculator allowed by the regulations of the Joint 
Council for Qualifications.  Calculators must not have the facility for 
symbolic algebra manipulation, differentiation and integration, or have 
retrievable mathematical formulas stored in them.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write your centre number, candidate number, your surname, initial(s) 
and signature. 
Check that you have the correct question paper.
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
The marks for individual questions and the parts of questions are shown in round brackets: e.g. (2).
There are 9 questions in this question paper.  The total mark for this paper is 75.  
There are 4 pages in this question paper.  Any blank pages are indicated.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You should show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner.
