Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility 
for symbolic algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus 
candidates may NOT use calculators such as the Texas Instruments 
TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 48G. 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre 
number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S3), the paper reference (6685), your 
surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions.  
The total mark for this paper is 75. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

Over a period of time, researchers took 10 blood samples from one patient with a blood disease. 
For each sample, they measured the levels of serum magnesium, s mg/dl, in the blood and the 
corresponding level of the disease protein, d mg/dl. The results are shown in the table.

A computer company repairs large numbers of PCs and wants to estimate the mean time to repair 
a particular fault. Five repairs are chosen at random from the company’s records and the times 
taken, in seconds, are  
 
205       310       405       195       320. 
 
(a) Calculate unbiased estimates of the mean and the variance of the population of repair times 
from which this sample has been taken. 
(4) 
 
It is known from previous results that the standard deviation of the repair time for this fault is 
100 seconds. The company manager wants to ensure that there is a probability of at least 0.95 
that the estimate of the population mean lies within 20 seconds of its true value. 
 
(b) Find the minimum sample size required.

A manufacturer produces two flavours of soft drink, cola and lemonade. The weights, C and L, 
in grams, of randomly selected cola and lemonade cans are such that C ∼ N(350, 8) and 
L ∼ N(345, 17). 
 
(a) Find the probability that the weights of two randomly selected cans of cola will differ by 
more than 6 g. 
(6) 
 
One can of each flavour is selected at random. 
 
(b) Find the probability that the can of cola weighs more than the can of lemonade. 
(6) 
 
Cans are delivered to shops in boxes of 24 cans. The weights of empty boxes are normally 
distributed with mean 100 g and standard deviation 2 g. 
 
(c) Find the probability that a full box of cola cans weighs between 8.51 kg and 8.52 kg. 
(6) 
(d) State an assumption you made in your calculation in part (c).
