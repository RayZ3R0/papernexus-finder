Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for 
symbolic algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT 
use calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, 
Hewlett Packard HP 48G. 
 
 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre 
number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S3), the paper reference (6685), your 
surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions.  
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

1. 
Explain how to obtain a sample from a population using  
 
(a) stratified sampling, 
(2) 
(b) quota sampling. 
(2) 
 
Give one advantage and one disadvantage of each sampling method. 
(4) 
 
 
2. 
A random sample of 30 apples was taken from a batch. The mean weight of the sample was 
124 g with standard deviation 20 g. 
 
(a) Find a 99% confidence interval for the mean weight µ grams of the population of apples. 
Write down any assumptions you made in your calculations. 
(6) 
 
Given that the actual value of µ is 140, 
 
(b) state, with a reason, what you can conclude about the sample of 30 apples. 
(2) 
 
 
3. 
Given the random variables X ~ N(20, 5) and Y ~ N(10, 4) where X and Y are independent, find 
 
(a) E(X – Y), 
(2) 
(b) Var(X – Y), 
(2) 
(c) P(13 < X – Y < 16).

4. 
A new drug to treat the common cold was used with a randomly selected group of 100 
volunteers. Each was given the drug and their health was monitored to see if they caught a cold. 
A randomly selected control group of 100 volunteers was treated with a dummy pill. The results 
are shown in the table below.

Using a 5% significance level, test whether or not the chance of catching a cold is affected by 
taking the new drug. State your hypotheses clearly.

5.  
A scientist monitored the levels of river pollution near a factory. Before the factory was closed 
down she took 100 random samples of water from different parts of the river and found an 
average weight of pollutants of 10 mg l−1 with a standard deviation of 2.64 mg l−1. After the 
factory was closed down the scientist collected a further 120 random samples and found that they 
contained 8 mg l−1 of pollutants on average with a standard deviation of 1.94 mg l−1. 
 
Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not the mean river pollution fell after the factory 
closed down.

A bag contains a large number of coins of which 30% are 50p coins, 20% are 10p coins and the 
rest are 2p coins. 
 
(a) Find the mean µ and the variance σ 2 of this population of coins. 
(4) 
 
A random sample of 2 coins is drawn from the bag one after the other. 
 
(b) List all possible samples that could be drawn. 
(2) 
(c) Find the sampling distribution of X , the mean of the coins drawn. 
(4) 
(d) Find P(2 ≤ X  < 7). 
(2) 
(e) Use the sampling distribution of X  to verify E( X ) = µ and Var( X ) = 2
