Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G. 
 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S3), the paper reference (6685), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions. Pages 6, 7 and 8 are blank. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

1. 
A hotel has 160 rooms of which 20 are classified as De-luxe, 40 Premier and 100 as 
Standard. The manager wants to obtain information about room usage in the hotel by 
taking a 10% sample of the rooms. 
 
(a) Suggest a suitable sampling method. 
 
              
(1)   
(b) Explain in detail how the manager should obtain the sample.

A random sample of 100 classical CDs produced by a record company had a mean 
playing time of 70.6 minutes and a standard deviation of 9.1 minutes. An independent 
random sample of 120 CDs produced by a different company had a mean playing 
time of 67.2 minutes with a standard deviation of 8.4 minutes. 
 
 
(a) Using a 1% level of significance, test whether or not there is a difference in the 
mean playing times of the CDs produced by these two companies. State your 
hypotheses clearly. 
(8) 
 
(b) State an assumption you made in carrying out the test in part (a).

The weights of a group of males are normally distributed with mean 80 kg and 
standard deviation 2.6 kg. A random sample of 10 of these males is selected. 
       
(a) Write down the distribution of M , the mean weight, in kg, of this sample. 
(2) 
(b) Find P( M < 78.5).  
(3) 
The weights of a group of females are normally distributed with mean 59 kg and 
standard deviation 1.9 kg. A random sample of 6 of the males and 4 of the females 
enters a lift that can carry a maximum load of 730 kg. 
 
(c) Find the probability that the maximum load will be exceeded when these 10 
people enter the lift. 
                                                                                                                              (5)

(a) Calculate the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between performance and 
dedication. 
(5) 
(b) Stating clearly your hypotheses and using a 10% level of significance, interpret 
your rank correlation coefficient. 
(5) 
(c) Give a reason to support the use of the rank correlation coefficient rather than the 
product moment correlation coefficient with these data.

Making your method clear, test whether or not there is any evidence of an association 
between gender and use of the club facilities. State your hypotheses clearly and use a 
5% level of significance.

Data were collected on the number of female puppies born in 200 litters of size 8. It 
was decided to test whether or not a binomial model with parameters n = 8 and 
p = 0.5 is a suitable model for these data. The following table shows the observed 
frequencies and the expected frequencies, to 2 decimal places, obtained in order to 
carry out this test.

(4) 
(b) Carry out the test to determine whether or not this binomial model is a suitable 
one. State your hypotheses clearly and use a 5% level of significance. 
(7) 
An alternative test might have involved estimating p rather than assuming p = 0.5. 
 
(c) Explain how this would have affected the test.

The weights of tubs of margarine are known to be normally distributed. A random 
sample of 10 tubs of margarine were weighed, to the nearest gram, and the results 
were as follows. 
 
498   502   500   496   509   504   511   497   506   499 
 
 
 
 
(a) Find unbiased estimates of the mean and the variance of the population from 
which this sample was taken. 
(5) 
 
Given that the population standard deviation is 5.0 g, 
 
 
 
(b) estimate limits, to 2 decimal places, between which 90% of the weights of the 
tubs lie, 
(2) 
 
 
(c) find a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of the tubs. 
(5) 
 
A second random sample of 15 tubs was found to have a mean weight of 501.9 g. 
 
 
(d) Stating your hypotheses clearly and using a 1% level of significance, test whether 
or not the mean weight of these tubs is greater than 500 g.
