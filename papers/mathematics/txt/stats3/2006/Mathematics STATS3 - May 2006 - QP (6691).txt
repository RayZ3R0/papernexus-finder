In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your centre 
number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S3), the paper reference (6685), your 
surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the answer 
should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has 8 questions.  
The total mark for this paper is 75. 
 
Advice to Candidates

(b) simple random sampling.

A report on the health and nutrition of a population stated that the mean height of three-year old 
children is 90 cm and the standard deviation is 5 cm. A sample of 100 three-year old children 
was chosen from the population.  
 
(a) Write down the approximate distribution of the sample mean height. Give a reason for your 
answer. 
(3) 
(b) Hence find the probability that the sample mean height is at least 91 cm.

A biologist investigated whether or not the diet of chickens influenced the amount of cholesterol 
in their eggs. The cholesterol content of 70 eggs selected at random from chickens fed diet A had 
a mean value of 198 mg and a standard deviation of 47 mg. A random sample of 90 eggs from 
chickens fed diet B had a mean cholesterol content of 201 mg and a standard deviation of 23 mg. 
 
 
(a) Stating your hypotheses clearly and using a 5% level of significance, test whether or not 
there is a difference between the mean cholesterol content of eggs laid by chickens fed on 
these two diets.  
(7) 
 
(b) State, in the context of this question, an assumption you have made in carrying out the test in 
part (a).

(a) Find, to 3 decimal places, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the distance of 
the shop from the tourist attraction and the price of an ice cream.

(b) Stating your hypotheses clearly and using a 5% one-tailed test, interpret your rank 
correlation coefficient.

The workers in a large office block use a lift that can carry a maximum load of 1090 kg. The 
weights of the male workers are normally distributed with mean 78.5 kg and standard deviation 
12.6 kg. The weights of the female workers are normally distributed with mean 62.0 kg and 
standard deviation 9.8 kg. 
 
 
Random samples of 7 males and 8 females can enter the lift. 
 
 
(a) Find the mean and variance of the total weight of the 15 people that enter the lift. 
(4) 
 
(b) Comment on any relationship you have assumed in part (a) between the two samples. 
(1) 
 
(c) Find the probability that the maximum load of the lift will be exceeded by the total weight of 
the 15 people.

A machine produces metal containers. The weights of the containers are normally distributed. 
A random sample of 10 containers from the production line was weighed, to the nearest 0.1 kg, 
and gave the following results 
 
 
 
 
 
 
49.7, 50.3, 51.0, 49.5, 49.9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
50.1, 50.2, 50.0, 49.6, 49.7. 
 
(a) Find unbiased estimates of the mean and variance of the weights of the population of metal 
containers. 
(5) 
 
The machine is set to produce metal containers whose weights have a population standard 
deviation of 0.5 kg. 
 
(b) Estimate the limits between which 95% of the weights of metal containers lie. 
(4) 
(c) Determine the 99% confidence interval for the mean weight of metal containers.
