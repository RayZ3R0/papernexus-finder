In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Statistics S3), the paper reference (6685 or 
6691), your surname, other name and signature. 
Values from the statistical tables should be quoted in full. When a calculator is used, the 
answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
The marks for individual questions and the parts of questions are shown in round brackets: e.g. (2). 
There are 7 questions on this paper. The total mark for this paper is 75. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

A school has 15 classes and a sixth form. In each class there are 30 students. In the sixth form 
there are 150 students. There are equal numbers of boys and girls in each class. There are 
equal numbers of boys and girls in the sixth form. The head teacher wishes to obtain the 
opinions of the students about school uniforms. 
 
 
Explain how the head teacher would take a stratified sample of size 40.

A workshop makes two types of electrical resistor. 
 
 
The resistance, X ohms, of resistors of Type A is such that X ∼ N(20, 4). 
 
 
The resistance, Y ohms, of resistors of Type B is such that Y ∼ N(10, 0.84). 
  
 
 
When a resistor of each type is connected into a circuit, the resistance R ohms of the circuit is 
given by R = X + Y where X and Y are independent.

The drying times of paint can be assumed to be normally distributed. A paint manufacturer 
paints 10 test areas with a new paint. The following drying times, to the nearest minute, were 
recorded.

98, 
140, 
110, 
90, 
125, 
150,

110. 
 
 (a) Calculate unbiased estimates for the mean and the variance of the population of drying 
times of this paint. 
(5) 
 
 
Given that the population standard deviation is 25, 
 
 
(b) find a 95% confidence interval for the mean drying time of this paint. 
 (5) 
 
 
Fifteen similar sets of tests are done and the 95% confidence interval is determined for each 
set. 
 
 
(c) Estimate the expected number of these 15 intervals that will enclose the true value of the 
population mean µ.

People over the age of 65 are offered an annual flu injection. A health official took a random 
sample from a list of patients who were over 65. She recorded their gender and whether or not 
the offer of an annual flu injection was accepted or rejected. The results are summarised 
below. 
 
 
 Gender 
Accepted 
Rejected 
 Male 
170 
110 
 Female 
280

Using a 5% significance level, test whether or not there is an association between gender and 
acceptance or rejection of an annual flu injection. State your hypotheses clearly.

Upon entering a school, a random sample of eight girls and an independent random sample of 
eighty boys were given the same examination in mathematics. The girls and boys were then 
taught in separate classes. After one year, they were all given another common examination in 
mathematics. 
 
 
The means and standard deviations of the boys’ and the girls’ marks are shown in the table.

You may assume that the test results are normally distributed. 
 
 
(a) Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not the difference between the means of 
the boys’ and girls’ results was significant when they entered school. 
(7) 
 
(b) Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not the mean mark of the boys is 
significantly less than the mean mark of the girls in the ‘After 1 year’ examination. 
(5) 
 
(c) Interpret the results found in part (a) and part (b).

An area of grass was sampled by placing a 1 m × 1 m square randomly in 100 places. The 
numbers of daisies in each of the squares were counted. It was decided that the resulting data 
could be modelled by a Poisson distribution with mean 2. The expected frequencies were 
calculated using the model. 
 
 
The following table shows the observed and expected frequencies.
