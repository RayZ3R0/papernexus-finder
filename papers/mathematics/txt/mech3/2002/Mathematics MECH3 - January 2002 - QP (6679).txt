Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M3), the paper reference (6679), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s−2.
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions. Pages 7 and 8 are blank. 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

One end of a light elastic string, of natural length 2 m and modulus of elasticity
19.6 N, is attached to a fixed point A. A small ball B of mass 0.5 kg is attached to
the other end of the string. The ball is released from rest at A and first comes to
instantaneous rest at the point C, vertically below A.

A rod AB, of mass 2m and length 2a, is suspended from a fixed point C by two 
light strings AC and BC. The rod rests horizontally in equilibrium with AC 
making an angle α with the rod, where tan α = 4

BC, as shown in Fig. 1.  
(a) Give a reason why the rod cannot be uniform.

Figure 2 shows the region R bounded by the curve with equation y2 = rx, where r 
is a positive constant, the x-axis and the line x = r. A uniform solid of revolution 
S is formed by rotating R through one complete revolution about the x-axis. 
(a) Show that the distance of the centre of mass of S from O is 3

(6) 
The solid is placed with its plane face on a plane which is inclined at an angle α 
to the horizontal. The plane is sufficiently rough to prevent S from sliding. Given 
that S does not topple,   
(b) find, to the nearest degree, the maximum value of α.

A cyclist is travelling around a circular track which is banked at 25° to the
horizontal. The coefficient of friction between the cycle’s tyres and the track is
0.6. The cyclist moves with constant speed in a horizontal circle of radius 40 m,
without the tyres slipping.
Find the maximum speed of the cyclist.

of the sphere. The particle passes through the point B, which is in the same 
horizontal plane as O. It leaves the surface of the sphere at the point C, where OC
