Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M3), the paper reference (6679), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s−2.
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions. Pages 7 and 8 are blank. 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
without working may gain no credit.

A particle P moves in a straight line with simple harmonic motion about a fixed
centre O with period 2 s. At time t seconds the speed of P is v m s−1. When t = 0,
v = 0 and P is at a point A where OA = 0.25 m.
Find the smallest positive value of t for which AP = 0.375 m.

A metal ball B of mass m is attached to one end of a light inextensible string. The 
other end of the string is attached to a fixed point A. The ball B moves in a horizontal 
circle with centre O vertically below A, as shown in Fig. 1. The string makes a 
constant angle α ° with the downward vertical and B moves with constant angular 
speed √(2gk), where k is a constant. The tension in the string is 3mg. By modelling B 
as a particle. find 
(a) the value of α,

A particle P of mass 2.5 kg moves along the positive x-axis. It moves away from a
fixed origin O, under the action of a force directed away from O. When
OP = x metres the magnitude of the force is 2e−0.1x newtons and the speed of P is
v m s−1. When x = 0, v = 2. Find
(a) v2 in terms of x,

A light elastic string AB of natural length 1.5 m has modulus of elasticity 20 N. The
end A is fixed to a point on a smooth horizontal table. A small ball S of mass 0.2 kg is
attached to the end B. Initially S is at rest on the table with AB = 1.5 m. The ball S is
then projected horizontally directly away from A with a speed of 5 m s−1. By
modelling S as a particle,
(a) find the speed of S when AS = 2 m.
(5) 
When the speed of S is 1.5 m s−1, the string breaks.
(b) Find the tension in the string immediately before the string breaks.

A model tree is made by joining a uniform solid cylinder to a uniform solid cone 
made of the same material. The centre O of the base of the cone is also the centre of 
one end of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 2. The radius of the cylinder is r and the 
radius of the base of the cone is 2r. The height of the cone and the height of the 
cylinder are each h. The centre of mass of the model is at the point G. 
(a) Show that OG = 14

The model stands on a desk top with its plane face in contact with the desk top. The 
desk top is tilted until it makes an angle α with the horizontal, where tan α = 26

desk top is rough enough to prevent slipping and the model is about to topple. 
(b) Find r in terms of h.
