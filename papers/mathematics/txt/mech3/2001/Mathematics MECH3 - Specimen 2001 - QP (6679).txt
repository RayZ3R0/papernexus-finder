Graph Paper (ASG2)
Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use
calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G,
Hewlett Packard HP 48G.
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M3), the paper reference (6679),
your surname, other name and signature.
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s2.
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

Figure 1
A car moves round a bend in a road which is banked at an angle α to the horizontal, as shown in
Fig. 1. The car is modelled as a particle moving in a horizontal circle of radius 100 m. When the
car moves at a constant speed of 14 m s1, there is no sideways frictional force on the car.
Find, in degrees to one decimal place, the value of α.

Two elastic ropes each have natural length 30 cm and modulus of elasticity λ N. One end of each
rope is attached to a lead weight P of mass 2 kg and the other ends are attached to two points A
and B on a horizontal ceiling, where AB = 72 cm.  The weight hangs in equilibrium 15 cm below
the ceiling, as shown in Fig. 2. By modelling P as a particle and the ropes as light elastic strings,
(a) find, to one decimal place, the value of λ .

A man of mass 75 kg is attached to one end of a light elastic rope of natural length 12 m. The
other end of the rope is attached to a point on the edge of a horizontal ledge 19 m above the
ground. The man steps off the ledge and falls vertically under gravity. The man is modelled as a
particle falling from rest. He is brought to instantaneous rest by the rope when he is 1 m above
the ground.  
Find
(a) the modulus of elasticity of the rope,

(b) the speed of the man when he is 2 m above the ground, giving your answer in m s1 to
3 significant figures.

A uniform solid, S, is placed with its plane face on horizontal ground. The solid consists of a
right circular cylinder, of radius r and height r, joined to a right circular cone, of radius r and

A particle P is attached to one end of a light inextensible string of length a. The other end of the
string is attached to a fixed point O. The particle is hanging in equilibrium below O when it
receives a horizontal impulse giving it a speed u, where u2 = 3ga. The string becomes slack
when P is at the point B. The line OB makes an angle  with the upward vertical.
