Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard HP 
48G
Instructions to Candidates
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M3), the paper reference (6679), 
your surname, other name and signature.
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s2.
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
Information for Candidates
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided.
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions.
This paper has seven questions.
Advice to Candidates
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled.
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers
without working may gain no credit.

A smooth solid hemisphere, of radius 0.8 m and centre O, is fixed with its plane 
face on a horizontal table. A particle of mass 0.5 kg is projected horizontally with 
speed u m s1 from the highest point A of the hemisphere. The particle leaves the 
hemisphere at the point B, which is a vertical distance of 0.2 m below the level 
of A. The speed of the particle at B is v m s1 and the angle between OA and OB

A light horizontal spring, of natural length 0.25 m and modulus of elasticity 52 N, 
is fastened at one end to a point A. The other end of the spring is fastened to a 
small wooden block B of mass 1.5 kg which is on a horizontal table, as shown in 
Fig. 2. The block is modelled as a particle.
The table is initially assumed to be smooth. The block is released from rest when 
it is a distance 0.3 m from A. By using the principle of the conservation of 
energy,
(a) find, to 3 significant figures, the speed of B when it is a distance 0.25 m 
from A.
