Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use 
calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett 
Packard HP 48G. 
 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M3), the paper reference (6679), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s2. 
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
The marks for individual questions and the parts of questions are shown in round brackets: e.g. (2). 
There are 7 questions on this paper. The total mark for this paper is 75. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
 
without working may gain no credit.

A rocket is fired vertically upwards with speed U from a point on the Earth’s surface. The 
rocket is modelled as a particle P of constant mass m, and the Earth as a fixed sphere of 
radius R. At a distance x from the centre of the Earth, the speed of P is v. The only force 
acting on P is directed towards the centre of the Earth and has magnitude

A body consists of a uniform solid circular cylinder C, together with a uniform solid 
hemisphere H which is attached to C. The plane face of H coincides with the upper plane face 
of C, as shown in Figure 2. The cylinder C has base radius r, height h and mass 3M. The mass 
of H is 2M. The point O is the centre of the base of C.
