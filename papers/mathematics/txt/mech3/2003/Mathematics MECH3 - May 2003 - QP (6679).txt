Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard 
HP 48G. 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M3), the paper reference (6679), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s−2.
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions.

1.
A particle P of mass m is held at a point A on a rough horizontal plane. The coefficient of friction
between P and the plane is 3
2 . The particle is attached to one end of a light elastic string, of
natural length a and modulus of elasticity 4mg. The other end of the string is attached to a fixed
point O on the plane, where OA = 2
3 a. The particle P is released from rest and comes to rest at a
point B, where OB < a.
Using the work-energy principle, or otherwise, calculate the distance AB.

A car moves round a bend which is banked at a constant angle of 10° to the horizontal. When the
car is travelling at a constant speed of 18 m s−1, there is no sideways frictional force on the car.
The car is modelled as a particle moving in a horizontal circle of radius r metres.
Calculate the value of r.

3.
A toy car of mass 0.2 kg is travelling in a straight line on a horizontal floor. The car is modelled
as a particle. At time t = 0 the car passes through a fixed point O. After t seconds the speed of the
car is v m s−1 and the car is at a point P with OP = x metres. The resultant force on the car is
modelled as 10
1 x(4 – 3x) N in the direction OP. The car comes to instantaneous rest when x = 6.

(a) an expression for v2 in terms of x,

(b) the initial speed of the car.

A particle P of mass m is attached to the ends of two light inextensible strings AP and BP each of 
length l. The ends A and B are attached to fixed points, with A vertically above B and AB  = 2

A particle P of mass 0.8 kg is attached to one end A of a light elastic spring OA, of natural length
60 cm and modulus of elasticity 12 N. The spring is placed on a smooth horizontal table and the
end O is fixed. The particle P is pulled away from O to a point B, where OB = 85 cm, and is
released from rest.

A particle is at the highest point A on the outer surface of a fixed smooth sphere of radius a and 
centre O. The lowest point B of the sphere is fixed to a horizontal plane. The particle is projected 
horizontally from A with speed u, where u < √(ag). The particle leaves the sphere at the point C, 
where OC makes an angle θ  with the upward vertical, as shown in Fig. 2.

A tool is modelled as having two components, a solid uniform cylinder C and the solid S. The 
diameter of C is 4 cm and the length of C is 8 cm. One end of C coincides with the plane face 
of S. The components are made of different materials. The weight of C is l0W newtons and the 
weight of S is 2W newtons. The tool lies in equilibrium with its axis of symmetry horizontal on 
two smooth supports A and B, which are at the ends of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 4.
