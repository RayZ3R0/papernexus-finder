Candidates may use any calculator EXCEPT those with the facility for symbolic 
algebra, differentiation and/or integration. Thus candidates may NOT use calculators 
such as the Texas Instruments TI 89, TI 92, Casio CFX 9970G, Hewlett Packard 
HP 48G. 
 
 
Instructions to Candidates 
In the boxes on the answer book, write the name of the examining body (Edexcel), your 
centre number, candidate number, the unit title (Mechanics M3), the paper reference (6679), 
your surname, other name and signature. 
Whenever a numerical value of g is required, take g = 9.8 m s2. 
When a calculator is used, the answer should be given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 
 
Information for Candidates 
A booklet ‘Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables’ is provided. 
Full marks may be obtained for answers to ALL questions. 
This paper has seven questions. Pages 6, 7 and 8 are blank. 
 
Advice to Candidates 
You must ensure that your answers to parts of questions are clearly labelled. 
You must show sufficient working to make your methods clear to the Examiner. Answers 
 
without working may gain no credit.

A particle of mass 5 kg is attached to one end of two light elastic strings. The other ends of the 
strings are attached to a hook on a beam. The particle hangs in equilibrium at a distance 120 cm 
below the hook with both strings vertical, as shown in Fig. 1. One string has natural length 100 
cm and modulus of elasticity 175 N. The other string has natural length 90 cm and modulus of 
elasticity  newtons. 
 
 
 
 
 
Find the value of .

A light inextensible string of length 8l has its ends fixed to two points A and B, where A is 
vertically above B. A small smooth ring of mass m is threaded on the string. The ring is moving 
with constant speed in a horizontal circle with centre B and radius 3l, as shown in Fig. 2. Find  
 
(a) the tension in the string, 
(3) 
 
(b) the speed of the ring.

(c) State briefly in what way your solution might no longer be valid if the ring were firmly 
attached to the string.

A child’s toy consists of a uniform solid hemisphere attached to a uniform solid cylinder. The 
plane face of the hemisphere coincides with the plane face of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 3. 
The cylinder and the hemisphere each have radius r, and the height of the cylinder is h. The 
material of the hemisphere is 6 times as dense as the material of the cylinder. The toy rests in 
equilibrium on a horizontal plane with the cylinder above the hemisphere and the axis of the 
cylinder vertical.  
 
(a) Show that the distance d of the centre of mass of the toy from its lowest point O is given by

Part of a hollow spherical shell, centre O and radius a, is removed to form a bowl with a plane 
circular rim. The bowl is fixed with the circular rim uppermost and horizontal. The point A is 
the lowest point of the bowl. The point B is on the rim of the bowl and AOB = 120, as shown 
in Fig. 4. A smooth small marble of mass m is placed inside the bowl at A and given an initial 
horizontal speed u. The direction of motion of the marble lies in the vertical plane AOB. The 
marble stays in contact with the bowl until it reaches B. When the marble reaches B, its speed 
is v.

(b) For the case when u2 = 6ga, find the normal reaction of the bowl on the marble as the 
marble reaches B.
