length 1.5 m. The other end of the string is attached to a fixed point A. The particle is moving, 
with the string taut, in a horizontal circle with centre O vertically below A. The particle is 
moving with constant angular speed 2.7 rad s–1. Find 
 
 
(a) the tension in the string,

uniform solid right circular cone of mass m, where 2m < M. The cone has vertex O, base 
radius r and height 3r. Its plane face, with diameter AB, coincides with the plane face of the 
hemisphere, as shown in Figure 1.

In a game at a fair, a small target C moves horizontally with simple harmonic motion between 
the points A and B, where AB = 4L.  The target moves inside a box and takes 3 s to travel 
from A to B. A player has to shoot at C, but C is only visible to the player when it passes a 
window PQ, where PQ = b. The window is initially placed with Q at the point as shown in 
Figure 4. The target C takes 0.75 s to pass from Q to P.

A light spring of natural length L has one end attached to a fixed point A. A particle P of 
mass m is attached to the other end of the spring. The particle is moving vertically. As it

A trapeze artiste of mass 60 kg is attached to the end A of a light inextensible rope OA of 
length 5 m. The artiste must swing in an arc of a vertical circle, centre O, from a platform P to 
another platform Q, where PQ is horizontal. The other end of the rope is attached to the fixed 
point O which lies in the vertical plane containing PQ, with  POQ = 120 and 
OP = OQ = 5 m, as shown in Figure 6. 
 
  
As part of her act, the artiste projects herself from P with speed 15 m s–1 in a direction 
perpendicular to the rope OA and in the plane POQ. She moves in a circular arc towards Q. At 
the lowest point of her path she catches a ball of mass m kg which is travelling towards her 
with speed 3 m s–1 and parallel to QP. After catching the ball, she comes to rest at the point Q.  
 
 
By modelling the artiste and the ball as particles and ignoring her air resistance, find 
 
 
(a) the speed of the artiste immediately before she catches the ball, 
(4) 
 
(b) the value of m, 
(7) 
 
(c) the tension in the rope immediately after she catches the ball.
